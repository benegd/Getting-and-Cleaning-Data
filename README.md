##Summary
Script for reformating the data using r. Combining both the test and training data into a single data set (alldata) with mean and standard deviation for all recordings.

Extracting mean values for all mean and standard deviation values based on subject and activity subset.

##File information
The script includes the following files:

* 'README.txt'

* 'run_analysis.R' - R script that runs the modifications
