CODEBOOK

Introduction
============
The 'run_anaylsis.R' script will generate several variables based on the dataset outlined in the 'README.txt' file. This codebook will explain associated values within each dataset.

Notes:
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1], excluding activity and subject

datasubset
==========
Summary- shows the mean and standard deviation data for all data in the test and training sets along with activity and subject data.


datasplit
=========
Summary- shows the mean of the data in the 'datasubset' split by both activity and subject

Variables
=========

subject - the number coresponding with a person in the trail
activity - the activity the subject was doing during recording
acc- accelerometer
gryo - gyroscope
freq - frequency
std - standard deviation
x,y,z - recording axis
t - time domain signals
f - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied

example:
		tbodygyromeanx
   	t  	     body      gyro   mean       x
<time domain signal><body><gyroscope><mean><x dimension>
